This is an app designed to manage your class schedule. It allows you to classify events in 4 different categories
1. Courses
2. Assignments
3. Exams
4. Personal/To-Do Items

This app allows you to create Course, Assignment, and Exam items, with relevant parameters for each individual type, edit them with prefilled text, and delete them from the list.
For To-Do items, you can also add, edit, and delete, with the added features of allowing a sort by name or date, as well as an ability to check items off the list and sort by completion status

See examples of the app screens below!
